  <div class="contentbg">
	<div class="content">
	<!-- Proximity -->
	<p class="name">The four pages are mainly divided into three part: the Logo, Submenu, and Main Content. Furthermore, there is a line to separate top and bottom part,
                    for Submenu and Main Content, I used different background color to distinguish them. Also, the thin line across the Main Content also make user easy 
					to find the corresponding part to Submenu.  </p>
	<hr class="subline"/>
	<!--Alignment-->
	<p class="name"> Based on the "F" rule which users will follow when they read the webpage, the lay out is justified that rule. Begin the Navigation bar to find what 
                     to generally know, they go to the Submenu to get details. The Main Content in the right gives more informations.	</p>
	<hr class="subline"/>
	<!--Consistency-->
	<p class="name"> As you can go through all pages, you will notice that every page has the same scheme, Navigation top, Submenu left, and Main Content right. Even the 
	                 font and color are all same to help people to navigate the pages when they go and back through the pages. </p>
	<hr class="subline"/>
	<!--Contrast-->
	<p class="name"> To make a clear difference between Submean and Main Content, I let the color, gery and pink, be inverse. Also, for the Navigation bar I make the color
	                 a little bit stronger. Especially for Products page, the name of product are also different from others, which make people could quick find what the 
                     thing is. </p>
	<hr class="subline"/>
	<!--user friendliness-->
	<p class="name"> There are three main parts for User friendliness. <br />
	1. Learnability:  Usually, the Home page is more important, soI put it in the first place of Navigation bar. Since I need to sell product, the products are second. <br/>
	2. Efficiency and Memorability:  Since the pages all have the same design, so users could quickly to learn how the use the pages and would not lost when jump up to another 
	page. Also, for the order process, it is very to handle, just put the required information and is able to check the purchase history.   <br />
	3. Satisfaction and Error Control:  The color used is basded on the Logo, which make the page look like together. After I validated the pages, there are no error. Also no
	dead-end links. That makes the less error. 
	</p>
	<hr class="subline"/>
	<hr class="subline"/>
	<p class="name"> I will put the order form and purchase history link right after the products, because when people selected the products, 
                     they would want to know how much they need to pay and may modify their choices. 	</p>
